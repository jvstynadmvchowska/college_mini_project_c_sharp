# College Mini Project using C\#
>Simple project required at my college. It may not be very complicated
>but shows that I came across object oriented programming.

## Idea
It's supposed to be a virtual car salon (written in Polish). Finish line of this project was to properly write into Wynik.txt file from main class which you can observe at your local repositories.

## Structure explained
There's a: 
* Car class (and more classes specifying the type of car)
* CarSalon class (basically list of cars)
* TypeOfEngine enum, specific Comparator class
* and few methods that are:
    * sorting cars
    * writing them into or reading them from files
    * displaying CarSalons 

## How does it look like?
